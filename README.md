# The Oscii Lexicon

A research project to learn, index, and display all lexical information.

## Getting started

The lexicon uses [PanLex](http://panlex.org/) data as a seed. To run the
system, first [download](http://dev.panlex.org/db/) a `JSON`-formatted archive
of PanLex data. Pass the directory containing all `.json` files as a
command-line argument to `org.oscii.Main`.
